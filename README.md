# task-tracker-full-stack
Task tracker app. This project was made with chatGPT.
I made this to help me learn more about setting up full-stack projects. I used CMD and git while doing it to make me more familiar with them.
technologies used: 
Backend: Python with Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using a simple framework like Bootstrap for styling)
Database: SQLite
Version Control: Git
Dependency Management: Virtual Environments and requirements.txt

This projects emphasis was to make everything work togther and deepen my understanding on that and backside.
The frontside of this project is really basic. (So is the backside)
